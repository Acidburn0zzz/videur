The **Videur API Specification** file is a JSON document that defines the
resources and behaviour of a web application. The goal of Videur is to
implement early filtering and validation of requests, to protect a web
application.

By default, a web application can publish a Videur API Specification file
at `<root>/api-specs`. That location is configurable.


The JSON specification defines a mapping containing a single **service**
section, that itself containing the following sections:

- **location** -- the root url for the service
- **version** -- the service version
- **resources** -- a list of HTTP resources for the service (see below)
- **configuration** -- a list of configuration options for the service (see below)
- **description** -- a description of the service (see below)
- **syntax_version** -- the Videur spec version, should be `0.2`

Examples for the **location** and **version** fields:

.. code:: json

	{
		"service": {
			"location": "http://127.0.0.1:8282",
			"version": "1.1",
			...
		},
		"syntax_version": 0.2
	}

resources
---------
This section contains a mapping describing all HTTP endpoints. Each resource is
identified by the exact URI of the endpoint or a regular expression.

Examples of valid URIs:

- **/dashboard**
- **/action/one**
- **regexp:/welp/[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,64}**

Regular expression based URIs are prefixed with the keyword `regexp:`.

The value of each resource is a mapping of all implemented methods.

Example:

.. code:: json

	"/action": {
		"GET": {},
		"DELETE": {}
	}

Each resource is composed of methods among `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` or
`DELETE`. Each method defines specific rules:

- **parameters**: rules on the query string
- **body**: rules on the body
- **limits**: limits on the request (rate, size, etc.)

parameters
==========

The `parameters` section contains validation rules that are applied on the
query string of the request. Validation rules follow a simple format:

- **required**: a boolean to indicate if this parameter is mandatory, meaning
  that requests that omit the parameter will be rejected
- **validation**: the validation rule itself

validation rule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The validation rule is a pattern that represent the expected parameter value.
It can take the following values:

- **digits:<min>,<max>** : the value is composed of numbers. Its size is
  between <min> and <max> digits. digits are treated as float64.
- **regexp:<regexp>**: the value must follow the corresponding regexp
- **values:<a>|<b>|<c>**: the value must be one of a, b, c. Each component is
  treated as a string.
- **datetime**: the value is an ISO date following RFC3339 format (ex:
  `1937-01-01T12:00:27.87+00:20`)

Example:

.. code:: json

    "/search": {
        "GET": {
            "parameters": {
                "before": {
                    "validation":"datetime",
                    "required": false
                },
                "after": {
                    "validation":"datetime",
                    "required": false
                },
                "type": {
                    "validation":"values:action|command|agent",
                    "required": false
                },
                "report": {
                    "validation":"regexp:[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,64}",
                    "required": false
                },
                "agentname": {
                    "validation":"regexp:[\\w\\n\\r\\t ]{0,256}",
                    "required": false
                },
                "actionname": {
                    "validation":"regexp:[\\w\\n\\r\\t ]{0,1024}",
                    "required": false
                },
                "status": {
                    "validation":"regexp:[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,64}",
                    "required": false
                },
                "threatfamily": {
                    "validation":"regexp:[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,64}",
                    "required": false
                },
                "limit": {
                    "validation":"digits:1,10000000",
                    "required": false
                }
            }
        }
    }

body
====

Videur can perform basic validation of a request body. This validation is
limited, because complex body checking would be too costly and hard to
maintain. Videur thus limits itself to verifying that a request body is either
empty, or is of a specific type. The accepted types are:

- **empty**: the request body is exactly 0 bytes
- **json**: the request body is correct json
- **xml**: the request body is correct xml
- **base64**: the request body is correctly encoded in base64

limits
======

Limits can be enforce at the resource method level. The goal is to provide
granular rate limiting to protect specific resources.

Limits can be applied at two levels:

- **rates**: a control on the request rate
- **max_body_size**: a maximum body size expressed in bytes. example: "10k"

Rates
~~~~~

Rates is an array, meaning that multiple rates can be defined for each
resource. When multiple rates are defined, all of them are tested against
incoming requests, and the first one that fails will block the request.

Rates are defined with three fields:

- **seconds**: the throttling window in seconds.
- **hits**: the maximum number of hits allowed in that window.
- **match**: an expression to uniquely identify a user

The **match** field is a logical expression articulated with **AND** and **OR**
operators.

Each value can be of the form:

- **header:<name>**: takes the value of the header <name>
- **any nginx variable**: such as $binary_remote_addr or just $remote_addr

Examples:

.. code:: json

    "limits": {
        "rates": [
            {
                "seconds": 60,
                "hits": 10,
                "match": "header:Authorization AND header:User-Agent"
            },
            {
                "seconds": 10,
                "hits": 100,
                "match": "header:X-Forwarded-For OR $binary_remote_addr"
            }
        ],
        "max_body_size": "10k"
    }

configuration
-------------
The configuration section defines behaviour that is global to the web
application. This section can be used to insert response headers, and declare
global limits. Global limits are overriden by limits defined by resources.

add_header
==========

This section contains HTTP header that are inserted in HTTP response. The
format follow a simple key:value syntax and no grammar is enforced by Videur.

Example:

.. code:: json

	"add_header": {
		"Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=15768000",
		"Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'none'; style-src cdn.example.com; report-uri /_/csp-reports",
		"Public-Key-Pins": "max-age=500; pin-sha1=\"4n972HfV354KP560yw4uqe/baXc=\"; pin-sha1=\"IvGeLsbqzPxdI0b0wuj2xVTdXgc=\""
	},

limits
======
This section uses the exact same syntax as described above in the
**resources/limits** section. Global limits are used when no local limits are
defined, and provide a base protection level to all resources.

description
-----------

description contains informative fields. Any information can be added in this
section. This is purely for management purpose and does not control the
behaviour of the web application.

Suggested values:

- **owner**: name of the owner of the service
- **developer**: name of the main developer.
- **operator**: name of the main operator

Example:

.. code:: json

    "description": {
        "owner": "Mozilla Operations Security",
        "developer": "Julien Vehent <jvehent@mozilla.com>",
        "operator": "Julien Vehent <jvehent@mozilla.com>"
    }
